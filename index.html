            <p>Hello! My name is Quelitho Gabriel I am from Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. I am a student at Brigham Young University.
                I enjoy playing video game, listen to music, I love hiking, and I love to read the scriptures and other books,
                I like to play football and I like to cook, I think I am a good cook,
                because I got a lot of compliments, when I was a missionary, and also in my family.</p>
                         
            <p>My mission helped me a lot to get closer to the Savior,
                it allowed me to help the people I met. Serving a mission was a difficult decision in my life.
                On my return I received the blessing of serving in the temple, these moments marked my life. 
                Since my return, the country has gone through difficult times, my family and I were forced to leave our home, 
                God in his love protected us and allowed us to find a place to live. I don't know how long these things will last, 
                but I know that God will continue to guide us and protect us.
                Making the effort to go to the temple as often as possible,
                helps me get through these difficult times</p>
